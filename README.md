# VirtualRealityFinalProject
This project contains an educational modules that can be used to teach certain concepts that can be better
learned in VR in a fun and immersive way.

This video gives a quick glimpse of the project:

It contains the following modules:

Homedeck:
This is the start up screen that the user will be greeted with. It offers the user the ability to choose from
either of the two educational modules: 
    1. K-D Trees
    2. Quaternions

K-D Trees:
This module has random spheres arranged in an environment. It is a visual representation of the KDTrees
algorithm running in the background that is used to generate planes to divide the space and spot the nearest
neighbor of the target sphere.

Quaternions:
This module has two sub modules. 
The first submodule is a tutorial that introduces the topic and shows a visualization of Quaternions being
applied to an object for rotation.
The next module is a game to put the skills developed from the quaternion demonstration into action. 

Here is a link to the executable version of the demonstration:
